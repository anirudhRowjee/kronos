# :clock: Kronos (WIP)

A Golang Implementation of Logical (TODO and Vector) Clocks.

## Background

Logical Clocks, also known as Lamport Timestamps, were introduced in Leslie
Lamport's seminal 1978 paper,
[Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System (pdf)](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf).

This is a simple implementation of the Logical Clock proposed here.

## TODO

- [ ] Distributed Mutex Example (maybe with deterministic simulation)
- [ ] Vector Clock
- [ ] Better tests
- [ ] Add a Mutex for concurrent access?
